## Must do DSAs

When giving an interview for product based comapnies, Data Structures and Algorithms are the most impoertant concepts one should focus on. The sooner you realize the importance of DSA in your career earlier you will get the fruits of the result. If you want to be well prepared for DSA questions in interviews then you will need to be a very good programmer and solve a lot of questions to maximize your coding abilities and level of confidence. 

You can refer this [**article**](https://dev.to/asmit2952/how-to-improve-logic-in-programming-54nd) in which I have covered on how to improve your logic in programming.

Here are some benefits of practising DSAs which would definitely help you ahead in your career.

* **Helpful in solving real-world problems** - Real world problems which would take months to solve can be solved within minutes if you have proper knowlwdgw of DSA.

* **Needed in Machine Learning Field** - Engineers with the knowledge of both DSA and Machine Learning can design some of the best products available. If an ML engineer knows DSA then he doesnâ€™t need to spend a large amount of time collecting data which can thus help him to solve complex problems easily.

* **Importance in Technical Hiring Process** - This is important to them as these companies encounter a lot of these complex problems daily and expect their programmers to be skilled enough to solve them in the least amount of time while using minimal resources.

The platform where you can practice the best is [**Leetcode**](https://leetcode.com/). It has all the questions asked in technical interviews of **MANGA** companies. It has different levels of questions from Easy, Medium and Hard levels to get you acquanited with the topic.

* ### Technical Interview Tips

  * **Conduct Company Research** - Make sure you fully understand the job description, technical expectations of the job, and company culture prior to the interview. Take time to understand trends in various IT businesses, as well as recent developments and projects of the company and industry.

  * **Practice Coding Problems** - Practice skills that match the job expectations with examples and modules from reliable sources. Be familiar with data structures and algorithms

  * **Answer Questions Directly and Confidently** - Be sure to use the correct terminology and concepts. It is also important to answer questions assertively to project confidence.

  * **Explain Your Process** - Technical interviews assess both your technical knowledge and your problem solving and critical thinking skills. Explain your thought process so the interviewer can evaluate your approach and your communication style. 

* ### After the Interview

Promptly follow up with a thank you email that reiterates your interest in the position. Write the thank you email or at least make notes of the interview conversation right after the interview for a fresh account of what was discussed in the interview. The thank you email should be sent within 24 hours.
